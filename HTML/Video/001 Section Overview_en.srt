00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,450
In this section of the course, we'll take a quick tour of the CodeLite IDE interface.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,350
It's important to feel comfortable with the environment

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,950
that we're using to create our c++ programs.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,450
So I'll walk you through the major functionality of the CodeLite IDE,

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,350
so you can get up and running quickly.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,250
Then we'll write our first c++ program.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,150
It'll be a pretty simple program that simply asks the user for their favorite number

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,950
and then displays it on the console.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,750
We'll use this program to look at the build options provided by CodeLite,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and I'll show you how they work and what they do.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,200
Finally, we'll introduce some problems into our program

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,400
so that you can see some of the typical errors

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,200
and warnings that you'll probably encounter as you write c++ programs

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
and understand them and know how to fix them.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,960
That's it. This section short and simple, but very, very important

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,160
since it lays the foundation for writing,

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,960
building and running c++ programs in the CodeLite IDE.

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,510
Let's get started.
